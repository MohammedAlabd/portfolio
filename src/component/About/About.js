              I was learning C and C++ language at first but then started to
              learn about front-End and after that i joined Re:coded Front-End
              Bootcamp with the hope to be a junior Developer When I was kid, My
              dream was to learn how to type fast and I was really curios about
              how the apps runs in my compute... Unfortunately My road was far
              away from the codding and I joined a Environmental engineering
              college and I passed the first tow years there, after that I
              realized that I don't want to be there, thats not me. so I started
              to learn codding by my own using youtube and I learnt C & C++
              languages and after that I met with an Iraqi software engineer
              working at facebook and his brother and they led me to inter the
              Front-End web development and then I joined Re:Coded Front-End
              Bootcamp
